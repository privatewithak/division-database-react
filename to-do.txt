This is going to serve as my to-do list.

1. Set up automatic updates.
  - I have a separate computer that I can configure to run headless and it'll automatically run the checker and it'll auto upload to github.
2. Fix username stuff.
  - I have literally no idea why the changing usernames is broken.
3. Add "portfolio" feature.
  - Tracks how long people are in their roles. Profile view now has a tab that can switch from event list and then portfolio view. (Thank you rickybaldi for the idea)
4. Former divisionals tab.
  - Shows former division people.
